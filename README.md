# Fcitx 5 for Android
## (WIP) Fcitx 5 Android Wrapper
> Next generation of Fcitx, now porting to Android.

> 新一代 Fcitx，现正移植到 Android。

## Help Wanted
I really need some help since I don't familiar with JNI technology, which used for link the Java program and C++ source code.

Obviously, porting Fcitx 5 to Android need JNI to communicate with Fcitx 5 libararys.

I'll appreciate that if you could give some ideas. Thanks so much ~
